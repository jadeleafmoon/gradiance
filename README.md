It can be played on both desktop and mobile devices, though currently runs better on desktops.


### Inspiration

I was learning Vue 3 and wanted to make something fun in the process. I was playing I Love Hue, and thought it would be a great exercise to make my own version. Coding up this game was a joy!

Gradiance is a play on the word gradient and radiance.
